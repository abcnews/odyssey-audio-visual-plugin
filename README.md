# Odyssey Audio Visual Plugin

A plugin for ABC's [Odyssey](https://github.com/abcnews/odyssey) Story Format that enhances video playback.

Originally developed for the 4 Corners [Black Summer](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-03/inside-the-australian-bushfires-crisis/11890458?nw=0&r=HtmlFragment) bushfires interactive.

## Usage

This plugin depends on [Odyssey](https://github.com/abcnews/odyssey).

Add the `odyssey-audio-visual-plugin` JavaScript to your article in CoreMedia (content id: 101718598).

Add `#audio-visual-plugin-mount` on its own line where you want the "enable audio" button to appear.

As the page scrolls videos will automatically play and audio will fade between the videos.
